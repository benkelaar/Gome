C[Black 3 is a relatively modern invention. It is a severe move which restricts White's movements. Some hair-raising variations are possible with c3, hence the nickname "the magic sword of Muramasa".

White responds with 'a' to 'c' (joseki). White 'd' is unfavorable with this pincer, as the pincer is in the way of White's extension. Var 5 ('e') shows White playing elsewhere (which is rare). White 'f' is no longer joseki, as Black cuts White regardless of the ladder.

g7, f6, e5, d4, c3, b2, a1

joseki outcomes:
a1 - Black right, White top
b2 - Black choice of right or top
c3 - Black choice or right or top
d4 - Black right
e5 - Black right
f6 - Black corner top; White center (not good for White)
g7 - Black right; White top (not good for White)]
