Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd];W[od]C[Cho U's first move is to approach the corner, in the opening this attitude is active.];B[dp];W[pq];B[dc]
;W[qc];B[ce];W[ic];B[qo];W[pl];B[op];W[pp];B[po];W[oo];B[pm];W[no];B[om];W[ql]LB[mq:a]C[W18:  The common play is to reinforce with the small knight's move at 'a', Black will hane at 18, this is a simple joseki.]
;B[ol];W[pj];B[nq]C[After the turn of B19, the play of the diagonal of B21 just appears in recent years, it is severe.];W[lp];B[lq]LB[oq:a][pr:b][mp:c][mo:d][kq:e][kr:f]C[When W22, with B23 Black can also consider first to wrap at 'a', after exchanging with W 'b', then B 'c', W 'd', B23, W 'e' and B 'f', Black can fight adequately.];W[mq]C[The wedge of W24 is a good move.]
;B[mp];W[mr];B[np];W[nr];B[mo];W[lo];B[mn];W[kq]C[Through W32, it forms a new shape, in terms of local variation, both sides can be satisfied.];B[rc];W[pc];B[qg]C[But considering that Black grabs the super big point in the upper right corner with B33 and B35, in the opening Black is a little ahead.];W[rb]
;B[qi];W[qj];B[pi];W[nj];B[rd];W[fc];B[ld];W[mc];B[or];W[pr];B[ee]C[B47 is Lee Changho's style, slowly accumulating strength.];W[cn];B[fq]
;W[bp]C[The knight's move of W50 is a little questionable.];B[cm]C[The attachment of B51 is an excellent move.];W[dm];B[cl];W[dl];B[bn];W[co];B[cj];W[dk];B[ci]C[Through B59, the whole left side already becomes Black's territory.];W[cq]C[Although White gets into the corner with W60 and also obtains some profit.]
;B[dq];W[bo];B[iq]LB[ns:a][ck:b]C[But the two-space extension of B63 again is an excellent point, White's defect in the lower right corner shows up (Black can hane at 'a'). Therefore with the earlier move of W50, White can consider to simply make the two-space extension at 'b'.];W[lf]TR[ld]C[W64: If White doesn't attack the marked black stone, White's territory will be inadequate.];B[je]LB[gd:a][gc:b][jd:c]C[B65 is light and nimble, but Black can also consider to first press at 'a', after W 'b', then Black jumps to 'c'.];W[fe]
;B[ff];W[ge];B[jg];W[ef];B[eg];W[df];B[dg]C[After the cut of W70, B71 and B73 are the strongest answer. Recently Lee Changho's play is relatively brave and unyielding.];W[ck];B[bk];W[bj];B[bl]C[The exchange of W76 with B77 is very damaging, Cho U seems to have miscalculated here.];W[if]
;B[jf];W[cf];B[de];W[fg];B[gf];W[cg];B[ch];W[bh];B[bi];W[be];B[gg];W[bd];B[bf]
;W[bg];B[af]C[B91 and B93 are good moves, White's big group has no way to live.];W[ae];B[bc];W[fh];B[ei];W[ag];B[cd];W[ai];B[aj];W[dj];B[dh];W[bb]
;B[ac]LB[cc:a][ab:b][aa:c][ca:d][he:e][hd:f]C[But when White clamps with W104, B105 is questionable, the strongest answer is to connect at 'a', next W105, B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White has no follow-up. In the real game Black's plan is probably to play hane at 'e', next making the extension at 'f', Black is very happy. This way although White obtains a big territory in the corner, but in the capturing race, it is tight ko, due to no ko threats, White is still not successful locally.];W[cb];B[cc];W[db];B[he];W[ec];B[bf]
;W[af];B[ad];W[ln];B[mm];W[oi]C[White has no assurance of success if directly initiating the ko, so White elects to strengthen the right side with W116.];B[ah]LB[ok:a][oj:b]TR[qi][pi]C[B117: Black should first exchange B 'a' with W 'b', this way it is not a pity to sacrifice the marked two stones as in the real game.];W[pg];B[pf];W[ri]
;B[rh];W[oh];B[rj]LB[qh:a]C[When White extends with W122, with the sequence following B123, Black elects the simplest play, the purpose is to first eliminate the ko fight in the upper left corner, but the value of taking two stones is indeed too big, with B123 for Black to connect at 'a' is better, the upper left is two-step ko, White can't win.];W[qf];B[rf];W[qh];B[qe];W[ph];B[hd];W[gc];B[bf];W[gp]
;B[gq];W[sh];B[sb];W[lc]C[Black eliminates the ko with B131, White ataris with W134 in sente, then crosses over with W136, the situation becomes closer, but the game is slightly to Black's advantage.];B[hp];W[jr];B[oq];W[os];B[rq];W[dr]LB[qb:a]C[W142: White should first connect at 'a' in sente.];B[er]
;W[cr];B[en];W[eo];B[fo];W[do];B[fn];W[gk];B[qb]C[While entering the endgame, Lee Changho is very clear, although White encloses a big territory in the center, but Black still keeps the advantage of about 10 points on the board.];W[ep];B[fp];W[lm];B[eq];W[ml]
;B[nl];W[rn];B[qr];W[hi];B[qs];W[ih];B[ig];W[hn];B[in];W[im];B[io];W[hm];B[jc]

;B[jl]C[In the end, Black strikes inside White's territory with B235, brilliant!];W[ik];B[lk];W[kk];B[kl];W[jn];B[jj];W[jk];B[ii]C[Through B243, White's center has been pierced through.

This is Lee Changho's famous game.];W[jo];B[hq]C[The game 12 will take place on 2/24.])
