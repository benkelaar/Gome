C[The maximum extension for Black. Black's choice of this extension is influenced by the position in the top-left corner.

White can answer 'a' through 'c'. Playing elsewhere is ot favorable, as Black can make effective use of this five-space extension. This is a relaxed extension so there are no fierce variations.]

C[Black cannot connect on the third line at 'a', and pushing at 'b' is bad, as Black extends along the fifth line.]
