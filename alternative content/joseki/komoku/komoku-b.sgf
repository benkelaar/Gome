C[White 2 is used with friendly forces backing it up. Its purpose is to prevent a pincer. Locally it results in a loss, but may be appropriate fuseki strategy. 

It was popular in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but is not seen often nowadays, having been replaced by the one-space high approach, with which it has points in common.

Black responses range from 'a' to 'd'. Black may also play elsewhere.
