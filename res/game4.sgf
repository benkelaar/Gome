\(The 1st Japan's Strongest Deciding Matches\)

Comment[\(* The 1st Japan's Strongest Deciding Matches are to have 30 games played.  This game is the 20th.  So 2/3 of the games have been played.

Wu 9-dan's record up to this point is 6 wins and 2 losses.  He has led far in front of other players, fully showing his extraordinarly strength. *\)]
White[dc]
;
Comment[\(* According to the rules, each player is to play 10 games.  Now \[Wu\] has only 2 games left.  One is to play Fujisawa 9-dan, and the other is to play Kitani 9-dan.  Both these games will be Go Seigen's turn to play black.  If everything goes as normal, the possibility that Wu will end up with an 8-2 record is high.  In recent years, Go Seigen 9-dan has never lost playing black, so this prediction \[8-2 record\] is reasonable.  Even with a conservative calculation, say 1 win and 1 loss in the remaining two games, the total will still be 7 wins and 3 losses, a 70% winning percentage.  Winning the title is unshakable. *\)]
Black[pp]

White[cp]
Comment[\(* The players \[other than Wu\] in this Japan's Strongest Deciding Matches have all beaten by Go Seigen \(and beaten to BWB handicap -- they received sente in 2 out of 3 games\).  In these Matches, no matter Wu's final standing will be 7-3 or 8-2, he will once again show his unbeatable form in 10-game series. *\)]
;
Black[eq]
Comment[\(* In the beginning of this game, both side chose common fusekis.  Takagawa Honinbo displayed his simple and steady style, keeping the sente effect throughout, and after he successfully tackled tough obstacles in the middle game, he grabbed the lead. *\) ]
;
White[oc]
Comment[\(* Go Seigen 9-dan saw the unfavorable situation.  He struggled by starting a ko fight, and the picture changed.  During the violent ko fight, Takagawa deliberated deeply.  After a long period of pondering, he delivered a famous and most extraordinary move, thus avoiding a local loss, and once again he passed an obstacle. *\)]
;
Black[ce]
Comment[\(* However, at this very moment, Takagawa Honinbo was careless at a move that he should have made a forcing move, and the game was led to tension once again.  The confusing situation lasted all the way to almost the end.  Suddenly, Takagawa made a strange move, and the situation sharply turned worse for him.  Facing the losing situation, Takagawa started a ko fight, hoping to turn it around with it -- the game became violent again.  In this game, ko fights were complex and spectacular.  Hopefully, the readers will not only learn how to think around a ko, but also have a taste of the subtlety of ko. *\)]

Comment[W #8 pincer.  The common belief is that when there is a structure like W \[C4\] and B \[E3\] \[marked\], W #8 to make pincer from this side is unfavorable.  This was already mentioned by "Kisei", the 4th Honinbo Dosaku Meijin \[17th century\], in his fuseki theory, and it has become a principle ever since.  The reason is ---

\[*** 'B' and 'C' to see references.\]

But here I had my own plan, so I decided to try W #8 pincer.

W #8 to play a pincer at \[a\] is common sense, and it's used in many games.]

B #113 itself is not a bad move, for it creates B\[c\] tesuji after B\[a\]-W\[b\] -- thus W cannot tenuki.  However, just because of #113, a peaceful board is suddenly violently disturbed.

Comment[After a long and deep deliberation, Takagawa delivered B #133, a move which was called a "famous move."

Before explaining B #133's purpose, let's look at two variations.

\[*** 'B' and 'C' to see them.\]

Now let's study #133's \[P15\]
effect.

If #133 can gain here in sente by pressing the W group at the upper side, *then* B turns to play \[a\] to get W six stones, B would balance out the loss shown in variation 1, and B would lose nothing in the ko fight.  Not only that, B #133 prepares to get some territory at the center.]

Comment[To here, B's loss is clearly bigger in the exchange.

\(* After the game, Fujisawa Hosai 9-dan, who was watching the game, asked Takagawa sensei, when B played #177, did he overlooked W #178.  Takagawa's answer was, "No, I saw W #178.  I played so for the exchange." However, the result of exchange was clearly bad for B, and he still chose to play this way -- this was quite hard to understand.  Anyway, no matter it was B's miscalculation on the exchange, or B's misjudgment on the whole board -- thinking that B had already trailed, so he looked for change -- this B #177 was indeed questionable, and Go Seigen 9-dan's comment that #177 was the losing move was understandable. *\)

Comment[When W #254 captures, B resigned.

\[*** 'B' to see a reference for a rough final count.\]

\(* At the end, W had only 8 minutes left.  This was rare in Go Seigen's games. *\)

\(* Takagawa Kaku 9-dan \[Takagawa was not promoted to 9-dan until 1960; clearly, these comments were edited after that.\] had won Honinbo title 9 straight times, and was thus awarded Lifetime Honorary Honinbo title.  Go Seigen 9-dan and Takagawa 9-dan had encountered numerous times in various matches.  For example, 1949 in Wu vs. high-dan 10-game series \(then Wu 8-dan, Takagawa 7-dan\); 1950 in Wu vs. 7-8-dan matches \(then Wu 9-dan, Takagawa 7-dan\); 1952 1st Wu-Takagawa 3-game series \(then Takagawa 7-dan, already Honinbo title holder and renamed Shukaku\); 1955 2nd Wu-Takagawa \(8-dan\) 3-game series; 1955 Wu-Takagawa 10-game series; 1956 3rd Wu-Takagawa 3-game series; 1957 The 1st Japan's Strongest Deciding Matches; 1958 4th Wu-Takagawa 3-game series; 1958 The 2nd Japan's Strongest Deciding Matches; 1958 5th Wu-Takagawa 3-game series; 1959 6th Wu-Takagawa 3-game series; 1960 7th Wu-Takagawa 3-game series; and 1961 The 1st Meijin Sen \(Takagawa already 9-dan\), etc. *\)]
