Comment[\(* This game is played near some hot spring in Matsuyama, Shikoku \[one of the main islands of Japan\].  Meanwhile, the game between Hashimoto Utaio 9-dan and Takagawa Honinbo is also played here.  The referee is Fujisawa Hosai 9-dan.  Shikoku is a place where Go is very popular.  This time, the arrival of five 9-dans at the same time \[should be four 9-dans; Takagawa is still 8-dan then\] is a rare chance for Go fans, thus the enthusiastic greetings from the fans are unprecedented. *\)]

Comment[B #3 to make a mukai komoku \[B #1 and #3 two komoku stones are "facing" each other\] is the fuseki I have used quite often recently.  When I was 4 or 5-dan, I'd sometimes play at \[a\].  This is only the difference in personal inclination.  Nothing deep.]
Black[cd]
;
Comment[If W\[a\] kakari from the other side, when B\[b\] and W\[c\], B would occupy \[d\] at lower left.  In such an arrangement, W #4 is better than Wa.  This is a common sense in fuseki.

Comment[Up to W #6, this opening also appeared in the games when I played Iwamoto Kaoru 8-dan and Takagawa Honinbo.  In thoes games, they played W too.

\(* Before, in a game between Sakata 9-dan, W, and Takagawa Honinbo, the exactly same opening appeared too.  Perhaps because of this, in this game, both side spent little time to get to W #6. *\)]

Comment[B #7 to play \[a\] for a one-space pincer can be also considered.  In a game between me and Takagawa Honinbo, I played this way \[reference 1\], and Sakata 9-dan played this way \[reference 2\] in Honinbo Sen.  In short, under this arrangement, there are various ways like one-space or two-space pincers.

Comment[Based on the reason described before \[see reference diagram at W #10\], B #11 to approach at \[C4\] is not very good, so B chooses \[C3\] kakari.
