Comment[\(* This game between Go Seigen 9-dan and Takagawa Honinbo is the first one since their 1956 10-game series. *\)]
Black[qd]
;
Comment[\(* This game was played in a hotel in Atami on February 20 and 21, 1957.  On this day, Sakata Eio 9-dan and Hashimoto Utaro 9-dan's game was also played here.  Kitani \[Minoru\] 9-dan and Fujisawa \[Hosai\] 9-dan also came to watch the games.   All six participants of the Strongest Deciding Matches gathered at the same place -- indeed a rare opportunity. *\)]
White[dp]
;
Comment[\(* In this game, Go Seigen 9-dan defied the traditional way of playing the so-called "great avalanche" joseki, making a revolutionary new variation that shocked Japan's Go world. *\)

\(* Generally speaking, new variations in josekis are made due to the following two reasons: *\)

\(* First, based on the surrounding situation, any known joseki moves is not satisfactory.  Therefore, to fit the current situation, one decides to make a change, thus a new move. *\)

\(* Second, contrary to the above case, one has fully studied a new move already, and he attempts to apply it in practice on purpose; or, in a game under appropriate situation, he suddenly realizes it's time to make this new move. *\)

\(* In the first case, a new move is made by chance under a special situation, therefore its application is quite limited. *\)

\(* Only the new moves made in the second case are purely new moves. The new variation Go Seigen 9-dan made has a fundamentally difference in the order of moves with the way everyone had been playing in the most popular "great avalanche" joseki.  Strictly speaking, it's a "revolutionary joseki." This joseki is extremely valuable for study, and it will be widely used hereafter. *\)]

Comment[Playing at hoshi points \[stars\] is what Mr. Takagawa likes. In the creation of New Fuseki Era, Mr. Kitani and I had studied san-ren-sei fuseki, and we often played at hoshi points.  Recently Mr. Takagawa often chooses these openings.]

White[ed]

Comment[W #6 also can approach from a lower position, point \[a\].

W played hoshi points at the two corners at the lower side, so he tries to get a high position at the top side as well.  To here, it's an opening also commonly seen if the colors are reversed -- That is, if B gets two hoshi points at the lower side, and W plays two komoku \[3-4 points\] at the upper side, B would then play \[E16\].]

Comment[W #12 is the biggest point on the board.

This move to play \[a\] at the lower side to form san-ren-sei is also a pretty strong formation, but W #12 also prevents B from extending from the komoku shimari \[corner enclosure\] at the upper right.  Therefore, #12 is the biggest point.]
White[pj]
;
Comment[In the past, B #13 had been normally played at \[a\] to split the side, but nowadays it's more often played as shown to approach the corner.

B\[a\] to split the corner shows an unhurried manner, while B #13 kakari tends to settle a local shape quickly.  This \[B #13\] implies the severity of modern fuseki.

When B #13 kakari \[approach\] ---

Letter[jq][qq][kq]
Comment[B #15 keima immediately is seen often recently.

If B #15 extends to \[a\], after W gets #15 \[Q2\], B will have to play \[M4\] to prevents W's \[M3\] invasion.

B #15's purpose is if W\[b\], B\[c\] extends.]
Black[pr]

Letter[qq][kq]
Comment[W #16 pincer is popular recently.

In this game, W's strategy is to form moyo in the center, so #16 pincer is certainly the move.  If W\[a\]-B\[b\], it would be following B's plan.]

Comment[If B #25 connects at \[a\], W would get the chance to play #25, and W is easy.

Since B has played #21 keima \[S5\] earlier, #25 should not play at \[a\].  The reason for #21 is just to prepare for #25 hane. #21 and #25 are related moves.

Comment[\[And\] #28 captures one B stone, but W eventually will have to spend one more move to finish the capture.  Thus, B gets the chance to play another move \[elsewhere\].  Although by capturing this B stone W could gain thickness, but comparing with B \[O2\] and W \[N4\] variation mentioned earlier \[B\[a\]-W\[25\] at node #25\], it's actually a one-move difference, and this difference is quite big.

B shown previously.

Also ---

\[*** 'B' to see another variation.\]

Now back to the game -- when there are those two marked B stones, 
W #32 is normally considered too strong.  The reason W plays so is because he has spent two moves to capture \[N4\] stone, so W is now trying to utilize this thickness.

Since W has invested for thickness, he now will have to make most out of this investment so that he will have the advantage in future battles.  This is certainly expected.]

Black[bc]
Comment[Since the normal \[traditional\] way doesn't seem ideal, I thought of #37 to bend inward.  This was a move that I had studied before.  Even without \[D10\] stone \[marked\], this \[#37\] would be a powerful move.

"Great avalanche" joseki had been used since 20 years ago \[20 years before 1957\].  Why had professional players never found this move \[#37 bending inward\]?  I think the reason was that the shape of this move didn't look good, thus it was overlooked, becoming a blind spot.

Comment[\(* Two days after Go Seigen 9-dan played this new variation, Sakata Eio 9-dan immediately applied this move in NHK sponsored lightning games, even astonishing his opponent Shimamura 8-dan. *\)

\(* Hasegawa 8-dan published an article, "My Study Notes", on "Igo" magazine \(1957.5\).  In the article, he studied this new move.*\)

White[gb]

Black[fb]
Comment[\(* Would this joseki \[after the change\] be widely used afterwards?  If "great avalanche" joseki thereafter disappeared in the games, then it would mean that people had the conclusion: #37 was indeed a great move \[for B\], and it led good results for B. If a variation is only favorable to one side, then it cannot be joseki, and it would certainly disappear in the games. *\)]

Comment[W three stones' \[D16-F16\] liberties are already tighten 
up, so B #49 to extend applies more pressure on W than simply to connect

Comment[W #50 is the only move.

If #50 plays at \[a\] \(\[D14\]\), when B attaches at #50, W is collapsed.

point to both sides.]
Letter[df]

Comment[B #51 was also considered to play at \[a\] to block W inside, 
but W #51 would live locally and even if B builds up thickness around 
this area, it would not be of much use, since W has thickness at lower 
right to balance out any B's thickness here.]
