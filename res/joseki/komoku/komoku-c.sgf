GM[1]FF[4]AB[qd]AW[nd]C[The great master Honinbo Shuei (1852-1906) favored the two-space high (niken taka-gakari) approach, especially in two stone handicap games. This approach move was very popular in the 1910s. Go Seigen frequently played this way, considering it a good "whole board" approach. In recent years, O Rissei has often used the two-space high approach.

Almost all variations have been completely explored. 

Black plays 'a' to 'e' or elsewhere ('f'). 'd' secures the corner, but is submissive. 'g' attaches to a weak stone, forcing it to strengthen. 'h' is an overplay.
