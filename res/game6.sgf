\(* Both Hashimoto Utaro 9-dan and Go Seigen 9-dan were disciples of Segoe Kensaku 9-dan.  Hashimoto was in fact Wu's elder study-mate.  Before Go Seigen's move to Japan, Inoue Kohei 5-dan had discovered Wu's genius when he visited China.  In 1928, when Hashimoto Utaro visited China, he played Go Seigen \(then 14\) two games.  Wu took black \(H-1\) and won both -- those were the first matches between the two; Hashimoto was 4-dan at that time.  After WWII, they played each other many times.  For example the 1946 Wu-Hashimoto 10-game series; 1950 Wu-Hashimoto 3-game series; 1950 Wu-Hashimoto 10-game series; 1957 the First Japan's Strongest Deciding Matches; 1958 the Second Japan's Strongest Deciding Matches; 1959 the Third Japan's Strongest Deciding Matches; and 1961 the First Meijin Sen; etc.  Go Seigen beat all the top players in 10-game series, as mentioned before, and the first 10-game series of such was started between Wu and Hashimoto. *\)]

\[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]

\[Indeed,\] based on the current positions, although W is thick, B is far ahead on territory.

W also realizes that the chance to form territory at the center is uncertainly, so he chooses to play #72, on one hand keeping a pressure on B team, while on the other hand waiting for a chance to play \[a\], using a ko fight to struggle.  This strategy itself was not wrong, but based on the later result, this #72 is questionable.]

Comment[After a long deliberation, W decided on #102.  This seems to be a defensive move, but in fact it's also aiming at B's weak spots.
