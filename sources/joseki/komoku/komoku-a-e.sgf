C[The low two-space pincer used to be the most popular. With modern Go emphasis on influence, the two-space high pincer has replaced it.

Possible White reponses range from 'a' to 'g', including playing elsewhere (h8). White must have the ladder to play 'd' or play elsewhere (h8).

Note, in contrast to the one-space pincer, the one-space jump (shown at 'i') is not joseki.

'j' and 'k' are mistakes.
