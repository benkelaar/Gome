C[The idea of Black 3 is not to fall behind in influence. White continues with 'a' to 'c'. 

White can only play 'c' with a favorable ladder to the lower left corner. White suffers a serious loss of territory with potentially no compensation if the ladder is not favorable and Black plays most serverly.

White 'd' is not joseki. White loses the corner.
