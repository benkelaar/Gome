Comment[Go Seigen \(Wu\) vs. Fujisawa

\(The 1st Japan's Strongest Deciding Matches\)

Black: Fujisawa Hosai, 9d

White: Go Seigen \(Wu\), 9d

Date:  January 9-10, 1957

Place: Atami]
;
Comment[This is my first encounter with Fujisawa 9 dan after the 10-game series 4 years ago \[1953; the 3rd Wu-Fujisawa 10-game series\].

Fujisawa 9-dan deliberates on every move; never hasty.  His steady and thick style has well settled in the Go world.

B #1 takamoku \[\(4,5\) point at the corner\] is rarely seen in Fujisawa 9-dan's game.  It's probably a personal interest intriguered by a recent game of mine.  This will be explained a little bit later.  ]
Black[pe]
;
Comment[\(* Fujisawa 9-dan's original given name was Kuranosuke, later changed to Hosai.  In his early years, as one of the strongest young players, he was regarded as unbeatable playing Black.  He was also the first player promoted to 9-dan after Honinbo Shusai \[the last Meijin\].  In 1943, as a 6-dan, he played Go Seigen \(then 8-dan\) a 10-game series in which he played all games with Black.  Fujisawa won the series 6-4.  Then in 1951, a 4-game series with Wu \(Wu won all four\).  In 1952, a 6-game series \(Wu 5-1\) and the second Wu-Fujisawa 10-game series \(Wu 5-2-1 with 1 tie\).  Finally in 1953, the third Wu-Fujisawa 10-game series, which ended after Wu led 5-1.
nst Sakata Eio.  Fujisawa played White and adopted a move-imitating strategy, but lost at the end to Sakata.  This game here is the second by Fujisawa after his name change.*\)]
White[qp]
;
Comment[B #1 and #3 occupying takamoku points at diagonal corners is the opening Suzuki Etsuo 7-dan used in a game versus me.  Fujisawa 9-dan was then the referee, and he watched the game from the beginning to the end.  That game was won by Black.  Perhaps Fujisawa 9-dan learned some winning strategy from the game, and here he applies the same "diagonal takamoku" opening.]
Black[do]
;
Comment[W #2 and #4 play komoku \[\(3,4\) point at the corner\], choosing a most common opening strategy.  So far it's exactly the same as the game between Suzuki and me mentioned before.  To resemble kendo \[Japanese fencing\], B raises his sword way above his head, ready to cut down, while W levels his sword, pointing to opponent's throat.]
White[cd]
;
Letter[po]
Comment[In the game mentioned before, Suzuki 7-dan suddenly played B #5 at \[a\], an unexpected odd move.  I guess Fujisawa 9-dan probably would not use such a novel move against me.  However it was not impossible, but I was ready.  In fact, even if Ba, there is nothing to be afraid of.

\(* Indeed, B didn't play \[a\], but #5, a common play, instead *\)]
Black[pc]
;
Comment[W #6 \[D3\] is the normal way against takamoku \[\(4,5\) point\].  Also, allowing B to have shimari \[corner enclosure move\] at both corners would be disadvantageous to W in an opening.  Therefore, #6 is also absolutely the move.]
White[dq]
;
Comment[B #7 is a basic joseki.

Fujisawa 9-dan used this move when he played 10-game series with me, and he had used it before that.  Also, he chose this joseki in Mainichi Shimbon sponsored Honinbo Sen.  This is a shape he likes.

If W plays here right away ---

Black[fp]

Comment[Anyways, if W acts at lower left right away, immidate fights are almost certain to follow \[as the variations show\], so I adopted tenuki \[ignoring lower left\], and turned to upper left.  W #8 shimari \[enclose corner\].]

White[bo]
Comment[\[Conclusion on variations of W #10\] When B #9 \[E2\], W can live simply with \[D2\] block.  However, if W just attempts to live here, it's definitely not the best strategy.

W #10 \[B5\], a "quick shift" strategy, is also a joseki.  This is a strategy I like.  I have used it many times before; it's a light way to play.]

Comment[B #17 good point.

\(* Since W \[M4\] is "high" \[at line 4\], B #17 also plays high to squeeze \[M4\] stone. *\)

Besides #17, there are several other big points on the board, but #17 is the most urgetn.

Next move W #18 is a difficult point of this opening, it's also a key to decide the outcome of the game.

Under this situation, most common plays \[for W #18\] are ---

\[*** 'B' and 'C' to see variations.\]]
Black[jp]
(
;
Comment[This move, W #18, is still better off to adopt the plays shown in variations 1 and 2.  W #18 led extremely unfavorable influence \[to W\] later in the game.  This is the intersection point of the opening, and based on the result, this move \[W #18\] is very bad.]

Comment[To B #29, it's a settled shape.

Although locally speaking, it looks like a "fair trade." But B #29 has a perfect distance from the shimari at upper right corner.  Counting this, W is at the lower hand.

Next if W\[a\] jumps, B\[b\] is a good point; or if W\[b\], then B\[a\] is a good point.

In short, this unfavorable result is caused by the "improper taste" of W #18 and #20 \[P4-O5\].]

Comment[B #95 should play B\[a\], since if B\[a\], W cannot \[L15\] -- B would have \[b\] against W \[L15\], and W's weakness is exposed.

Anyway, as soon as W is separated by B #95, W's middle team becomes thin, and W's plan of #94 \[F7\] to attack three B stones is out of reach.  Therefore, as said previously, W \[#94\] should play \[c\] to protect.]

Comment[\(Overview; continued\) W attempted to counter B's violent attack and rushed with #136.  This move was a serious mistake, led to B's sente attacks -- W fell to being one-sided attacked.  Although W tried to counterattack, but never got the chance. \(To be continued\)]

Comment[\(Overview; continued\) The battle continued to #154, finally making a ko.  This ko was very easy to B, since win or loss \[of this ko\] wouldn't effect B's being leading.  But it was on the other hand a huge, live-or-die ko to W.  With such a difference in lightness and heaviness, B eventually calmly played #155, filling up the holes at upper right corner. \(To be continued\)]

Comment[\(Overview; continued\) W #156 was the final struggle.  Since #157's response was inproper, the nature of the ko changed.  W suddenly saw a hope to turn it around, being obviously down.  Unfortunately, W #162 was less careful, finding a ko threat that was too small.  When B #163 finished the ko, the outcome was then decided. \[End of overview by Wu.\]]

Comment[\[Overview by Katsumoto, who collected these comments by Wu.\]

\(* From opening to middle game, Fujisawa 9-dan's unique thick and solid style was vividly shown on the board.  He fully exhibited his careful yet sharp character, and using thickness to apply violent attack is Fujisawa 9-dan's specialty.  We can see in this game, facing a strong oppoent, B played calmly, attacked completely, and advanced breathlessly, never giving W much chance.  This is indeed a recent masterpiece by Fujisawa 9-dan. *\)]

Comment[... to here is a certainly sequence.  Now, if W gives in a little bit to defend -- \[a\] isn't a bad move.

Of course, W lives even if without \[B2\], but let \[a\] sente to gain is quite intolerable.

Comment[... to B \[E6\], this joseki gives B a very thick shape.

B's next move can play kakari \[corner approaching\] at either upper left or lower right, and this is exactly W's opening plan.

Comment[To here, it's a joseki that was use often in very early years.  In this game, B is quite thick and thus better.  So recently, W has chosen to play simply \[H3\] instead of \[G4\] rush.
