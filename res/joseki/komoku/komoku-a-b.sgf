GM[1]FF[4]AB[qd][pf]AW[oc]C[The knight's move of Black 3 is a quiet response to White's kakari. It is not as solid as the diagonal play but it is more flexible, since Black can make a wider extension along the right side.

The main difference between the diagonal play and the knight's move is that White has the option of attaching at 'a'. White 'b' through 'd' are other options, depending upon strategic considerations.

Variation 5 illustrates White playing elsewhere.
