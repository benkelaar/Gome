Comment[Go Seigen \(Wu\) vs. Shimamura

\(Oza Special Match\)

Black: Shimamura Toshihiro, 8d

White: Go Seigen \(Wu\), 9d

Date:  December 21, 1957

Place: Japan]
;
Comment[\(* As usual, the winner of the Nihon Keizai Newspaper sponsored Oza title of each year got to play Go Seigen 9-dan for a special match. *\)

\(* The 3-game title matches of 1956 Oza were played between Shimamura Toshihiro 8-dan and Kansai Ki-in's Handa Dogen 8-dan.  Shimamura 8-dan defeated Handa 8-dan two straight, winning the Oza title, and as pre-arranged, he earned the chance to play a special game with Go Seigen 9-dan. *\)]
Black[pd]
;
Comment[\(* Durning last year's \[1956\] various games, the most notable player, besides Go Seigen 9-dan, was probably Shimamura 8-dan.  This showed his extraordinary strength.*\)

\(* In the "Hightest Dan" matches, Shimamura 8-dan won the title with a 6-2 score, and he would soon meet the title holder of 1957, Kitani Minoru 9-dan.  In the Honinbo league play, although losing to Fujisawa Hosai 9-dan and Kitani Minoru 9-dan, he was still leading overall.  Also, with an outstanding record in the preliminary round of "Japan's Strongest Deciding Matches", he had qualified for the semi-final round. *\)

\(* Showing such a tremendous strength in various big matches and keeping a steady record -- such players were rare. *\)]
White[dc]
;
Comment[\(* Shimamura 8-dan was just in such a good condition when he met Go Seigen 9-dan in this game.  Recently, the two had not met, so this was a game that people had looked forward to. *\)]
Black[dp]
;
Comment[\(* Three years ago, Shimamura 8-dan had met Go Seigen 9-dan in the Yomiuri Newspaper sponsored "Wu vs Selected 7 or 8 Dan" tournament.  Thereafter, Shimamura 8-dan gradually became a star in the go world.  This game was the first time since their last meet, and the Shimamura 8-dan of 3 years later had been different. *\)]
White[qp]
;
Comment[\(* B #1 and #3 occupied the two hoshi points at the diagonal corners, as if they were a 2-stone game setup.  This is an favorite opening of Shimamura 8-dan. *\)]
Black[oq]
;
Comment[\(* Shimamura 8-dan's style was that of "steady" type.  No matter how his oppenent tried to irritate him, he treated it calmly.  Making steady moves and approaching opponent gradually were his favorite strategies.  He was a player of lasting fights. *\)

\(* In this game, however, B had to give a komi of 5.5 points, the biggest komi among all the games \[of that time\].  Perhaps because of this, or because this was the first game with Go Seigen 9-dan after a long time and he eagerly tried to show the strength he had accumulated -- in short, in this game, he showed a style that was different from his normally steady and cautious approaches; instead, he played aggressively. As a result, however, because of his big misread, he lost a big group when the game was still in the opening period. *\)]
White[cf]
;
Comment[\(* From the watchers' point of view, this game was probably over by then.  But in reality it was not so simple.  The death of a big group didn't necessarily decide the outcome of the whole game.   Because of the inspiring struggle by Shimamura 8-dan, the game became less optimistic for W.  The violent fights continued, and for a while, it became an unclear game. *\)]
Black[jq]
;
Letter[po]
Comment[\(* Even though having captured a group of the opponent, it was not the case that one could sleep the rest of the way.  One shall see this point in Go Seigen 9-dan's clear and straight commentary. *\)

\(* One can also learn from this game that to eventually win a game, how much obstacle one has to overcome. *\)

W #8 to play at \[a\] kosumi would be solid.  Which way is better, keima \[#8\] or kosumi \[a\], depends on the surrounding situation.  This difference resembles the difference between big knight corner enclosure and small knight corner enclosure.  W #8 in the game was to look for changes, and it's a move of imagination.]

Comment[B #19 to play at \[a\] would be a passive approach.  Since B has the burden of 5.5 komi, #19 chooses the biggest extension.

Comment[These two moves are certainly the consequence of W #26 \[G15\].

Comment[Therefore, W #50 defends a move here.  But this move is wrong.

Had W #50 protected at \[a\] or \[b\], it would be W's favorable situation.  But since W played #50 actually, it left sente peep at \[b\] for B, and that directly influenced the attack on B \[D9\] stone.

Exactly where W should defend didn't seem to be a big problem, but it in fact affected the outcome of the game; the differece was huge.]
Letter[cg][bg]

Comment[\(* B made many moves at upper left corner, but still got killed.  During professional games, such a result means the collapse of the whole game, and it's almost impossible to turn it around.  But the subtle difference in W #50 brought a big change to the global situation, and one cannot say that W is absolutely leading now. *\)]

Comment[Since W doesn't have any severe moves to attack the B team right away, #54 decides to defend a move.  On one hand it keeps W's eyeshape, and on the other hand it eliminates B\[a\] tesuji.

Comment[B #55 good point.  Although W captured the upper left corner, but after the left side was damaged by B in sente, and B got the good point of #55, overall, W didn't gain very much.

Comment[If B #73 answers the threat with \[a\] to continue the ko, after W captures \[R18\], assume B\[b\] and W\[c\] next.

Comment[B would immediately settle this group on the left side.  Now rougly compare the territory on both sides in this picture: upper left versus upper right, B has about 10 points more; B and W are about the same at lower right; W's lower side is about the same as B's lower left; and B and W are about the same on the left side.  If so, even with B's komi of 5.5 points, W is not in much better shape.
