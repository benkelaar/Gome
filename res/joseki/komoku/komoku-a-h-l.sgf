GM[1]FF[4]AB[qd][ld]AW[oc]C[The two-space high pincer is most common. This pincer typifies modern Go, as it maintains balance between territory and influence, offers a plethora of options, and has few weaknesses.

White responses range from 'a' to 'k'. White plays elsewhere with 'l'.
White 'm' shows White trying to live at top.

White 'n' is not joseki.
