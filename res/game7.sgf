Black[qd]
Comment[\(* In these matches \[1st Japan's Strongest Deciding Matches\], Go Seigen 9-dan and Sakata 9-dan played a total of two games.  The result of the first game \[posted as Game 3 of the Go Seigen series\] was that Go Seigen won by resignation on B.  This game was the second match between the two; Wu played W. *\)]
;
White[dc]
Comment[\(* At the beginning \[of this game\], in an avalanche joseki at the lower right corner, Go Seigen 9-dan's W #24 should have captured a stone cleanly \[according to the joseki\], but to lure B to extend out \[the stone under atari\], W chose to play a move at lower left corner instead.  This unusual move, as an interesting inclination, certainly contained its speical understanding of the game, but it eventually brought W unfavorable results.  Thereafter, Sakata 9-dan \[B\] gained with move after move, and to the middle game stage, B grabbed the lead. *\)]
;
Black[pq]
Comment[\(Overview continued\)
\(* From then on, Wu fought hard all over the board.  Gradually he pulled it even, and the outcome of the game became uncertain.  But then, because of W #132 and #134's mistakes, B made an extraordinary move in W's territory, and B grabbed the lead again.  Go Seigen 9-dan then started a ko to struggle, and it turned out to be a favorable exchange for W.  The situation thus turned sharply, and this time W had the lead.  Finally, a big B team was invovled in a ko fight --- this was almost a free ko to W and B was therefore already in disadvantage, but B even decided to ignore the ko fight and jumped into endgame after tenuki.  This ko would directly decide the game, and with even one more ko threat, W would force B to a state of despair.  It became extremely tensive and violent on the board.  At the end, since B was under time pressure and he had no time to do the most careful calculation, B lost points during the ko fight, and B ended up losing by 4 points. *\)]
;
Comment[\(* This game was full of violent and nerve-straining fights.  Both sides spent a great amount of energy and brain cells.  Reflecting onto the board, it was a seesaw game from the beginning to the end.  This was indeed a rare masterpiece. *\)]

Comment[W #6 this move is often played at \[a\] after the War.

\(* If W #6 simply kakari at \[b\] instead of \[a\], then B's next move would certainly be at \[c\], a move implies both a pincer and an extension.  Therefore, W almost never plays \[b\] anymore. *\)]

Letter[pm][nm]
Comment[W #24's normal play \[joseki\] is to capture a stone at \[a\].  But if so, B would get the sente, leaving a possible jump of B\[b\]. Therefore, many people believe this shape \[after W\[a\]\] is B's thickness.  Besides, under the current situation, if W #24 captures a stone, B would certainly gets #24 \[D5\] for a kakari move.  Next ---

Comment[Had W \[D5\] shimari \[enclosure move\] at \[a\], when W #26, B probably would choose to play B\[b\]-W\[c\]-B\[d\] to form an avalanche shape.  But now the shimari at lower left corner is a one-space jump, therefore ---]

Thus, a big extension to \[a\] by B next would be a good move, since the shape of W's present enclosure at lower left leaves openings at the bottom, and B would be able to invade.  However, had W's \[D5\] move played at \[b\], B\[a\] extension would not be so good.  B #27 didn't go for an avalanche joseki, it was probably because of this thinking.]

Black[cl]
(
;
Letter[ck][bo]
Comment[B occupies the good point of #33 \[C8\], but W too gets a thick shape by #34 connecting.

In the previous diagram, B #33 to extend to \[a\] is joseki.  But the actual extension of #33 also aims at a subsequent ogeima B\[b\] to invade the corner.  From this point of view, the distance between #33 and \[b\] is appropriate.  If B tries to extend to \[b\] from \[a\] instead, there is a danger that W might counterattack with #33 \[C8\], an attachment on B\[a\] stone.]
White[ee]
;
Letter[cj]
Comment[B #35 has no choice.  Since B's extension \[to C8\] is one space too far \[comparing with joseki\], W is able to invade at \[a\].  B #35 prevents this invasion.]

White[kd]
Comment[W #38 is the big point of fuseki.  The three W stones at the left serves as a thick wall, and that's why W could extend as far as #38.  If W tenuki here, and let B extend to \[a\], the difference would be huge.  After this wide extension of #38, next W\[b\] hane, when B\[c\], W\[d\] hane again would be severe.]

In the future, W still can take advantage \[of \[C10\] stone\] to play \[a\] or \[b\]; the invaded one W stone \[C10\] is not so easily swallowed by B.

Black[mi]

White[nh]

Comment[Then B #73 keima to invade W's territory, gaining some profeit first.  At this point, B already leads on territory, so he avoids complicated fights like the one shown in the variation \[at node 70\].  Clearly, this is a wise choice.

To summerize the process up to B #73: W #44 did not capture a stone cleanly, and after B #45 extended out, W's working space became narrow, and his activities were thus limited.  During the conflicts that followed, W was unable to make a comfortable path, and B finally grabbed the upper hand, invading into W's upper side, establishing a winning form.]

The big B team from the right side to the middle is not completely settled yet.  If W loses the chances to attack this big dragon of B, W would lose the chance to win the game as well.  Therefore, W's top priority now is to separate this B team from the B stones at the top.]

Comment[B #227 this move to cut at \[a\] certainly gains more, but W wouldn't immediately answer B\[a\] with W\[b\]; instead, W would probably leave here as a ko threat.

Later in the game, a big ko fight will be created at the upper side, forming a situation that one more ko threat from either side would decide the game.  Based on this, B #227 did not really lose anything. \[It prevented W from getting one more ko threat, that is.\]]

Comment[B #271 finally finished this heavy ko.  Thus B let W get \[a\], and the outcome of the game is decided.

However, B #271 actually had another chance to struggle, this is, B #271 to extend at \[b\] instead, continuing the ko fight.

Had B chosen this path, what would the result have been?

Comment[\(* The ko \[M19\] was very light to W; almost "worry-free".  Therefore, B was already in a huge disadvantage.  Yet, B even dared to ignore it \[when B played \[G2\] cut\], stubbornly to continue the ko fight.  No one would have expected so.  Had Sakata 9-dan had more time to ponder, he probably would have found the way shown in the variation to continue this struggle. *\)]

Such a fighting spirit was astonishing.  Alas, he could not help the shortage of game time, and this fighting spirit was unable to hold to the end.  In short, in a match between two unmatchable top players in the world, the winning chance turned hands throughout the game.  This was indeed a rare masterpiece. *\)]

Comment[\(* Toward end of the game, a ko fight in which one more ko threat from either side would decide the game appeared.  In professional matches, ko threats are normally counted clearly before a ko fight is started.  In this game, however, the result of the ko fight was unclear until almost the end; this was extremely rare.  Perhaps because of the limit of the game clock, the players were unable to carry out throughout and accurate calculations; this could not have been helped. *\)]
