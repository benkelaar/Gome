C[Black 3, the famous Shusaku diagonal move, is a steady way of responding to White's kakari. Black can now aim to press against the lone White stone with 'a'.

White's possible local responses are 'a' through 'd'. 
White 'a': White must be prepared to fight.
White 'b': secure.
White 'c': invites invasion.
White 'd': played as an extension from the top left; invites invasion.

Variation 5 shows Black continuations when White plays elsewhere.

White 'f' is an Edo period (1600-1867) joseki that has since been abandoned as unfavorable to White.
