Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[The games between "teacher and student" Cho Hunhyun and Lee Changho are always very brilliant and enjoyable to watch, however we see less and less games between them nowadays.];W[dc];B[pq];W[dq];B[de];W[oc]
;B[cc];W[qo];B[co];W[qg]C[Each side plays on different places, it needs a very deep understanding to the games in order to keep balance in situation.];B[pe];W[pj];B[np];W[qb]C[W14: White takes territory and attacks first.];B[nd];W[nc];B[md];W[mc]
;B[ld];W[kc];B[og]C[From B15 to B21, Black plays on the outside, this will help the fight later on.];W[pl]C[W22 is steady, this is Lee Changho's style.];B[gq];W[ep];B[jq]C[B23 and B25 are big points.];W[ck];B[bq]C[As to the pincer of W26, Black flies in with B27 similar to the upper right corner, to keep balance in territory.];W[dn];B[cn]
;W[dm];B[cm];W[dl];B[ch]C[Next after Black crawls with B31, B33 seeks speed, this is a planned move when playing B27.];W[br];B[cq];W[cr];B[bl];W[bk]LB[cb:a][mp:b]C[B38 is a bad move. White should take tenuki and first play hane at 'a', Black can also attach in at 'b' positively.];B[dp]
;W[do]LB[er:a][eo:b][aq:c]C[W40 is a crude move. White should simply hang at 'a', this way later on when White has a stone at 'b' and plays hane at 'c', the situation will be different.];B[cp];W[er];B[fo]C[B43 is a sharp and good move! Due to the crude move of W40, Black continues to tangle, which is what Cho Hunhyun good at.];W[fp]C[W44: White certainly will counterattack. However, Cho Hunhyun is very good at this.];B[gp];W[go];B[fn];W[ho]
;B[gm];W[eo]LB[jo:a]C[W50 is almost the losing move, at any rate White should take the vital point at 'a', watch whether Black dares cut at 50.];B[jo]C[After B51, Black takes the initiative.];W[in];B[il];W[jn];B[ko];W[jl];B[jk];W[kl];B[ik]
;W[hm];B[hl];W[kk];B[kj];W[lj];B[li];W[mj];B[kn];W[ki];B[jj];W[jm];B[lh]C[The sequence from W52 to B71 is also almost inevitable.];W[gl]LB[ek:a]C[When White cuts again with W72, Black's three stones are already light. If White doesn't cut three black stones, Black will strengthen at 'a', Black's stone efficiency is very high.]
;B[gk]C[Black can sacrifice first with the atari of B73.];W[fl];B[fc]C[Then Black grabs the good point with B75. Black's advantage is obvious.];W[fj]LB[kh:a][ek:b]C[W76: White aims to pull out at 'a' and also guard against Black's peep at 'b'.];B[qp]C[B77 is a very big move.];W[rp];B[rq];W[pp];B[qq]
;W[al];B[am];W[cl];B[ak];W[aj];B[ao];W[kh]C[Since White has no enough territory, White is forced to pull out and fight with W88.];B[kg]C[Cho's style is not fearful of W88.];W[al];B[bm];W[ec]C[In order to help the center, White starts to move W2 instead.];B[cb]
;W[fd];B[gc]C[B95: Black is still tangling with White, in fact for Black to strengthen the center is already very adequate.];W[jh];B[hh];W[jg];B[lg];W[hg];B[gg];W[hf];B[fi]C[As to White's sequence following W96, Black prepares the attachment of B103.];W[gf];B[gj]
;W[fg];B[gh];W[cd];B[dd];W[ed]C[At the top, although White reinforces the cut in sente with W108 and W110, ...];B[ce];W[bd];B[bc];W[fb]C[..., but W114 preventing Black from crossing move also can't be omitted.];B[jd];W[kd];B[jf]
;W[ke];B[je];W[jc];B[ig]C[From B115 to B121, Black simply calls off his troops.];W[if];B[ih];W[id];B[qi]C[Afterwards, Black comes back to invade the last big point, Black already proceeds safely.];W[pi];B[qh];W[ph];B[rg]
;W[pg];B[rf];W[kf];B[ji];W[op];B[oq];W[no];B[mo];W[mp];B[nq];W[mn];B[lo];W[bg]
;B[cg];W[oo]C[From W134 to W144, White encloses territory at the maximum limit, but it already has nothing to do with the outcome.];B[ro];W[rn];B[sp]C[In this game, Black establishes superiority in the lower-left fight, later on Black tightly controls the situation, it seems Cho Hunhyun  again comes back to his prime time.];W[qn];B[rb];W[qc];B[rc];W[bf];B[be];W[lm]
;B[qa];W[ir];B[iq];W[gr];B[hr];W[hs];B[hq];W[fq];B[jr];W[pb];B[rj];W[rk];B[bi]
