C[The aim of playing the close pincer of Black 3 is mainly to build influence on the right. Therefore a Black position in the lower right corner is desirable when making this pincer.

White replies range from 'a' to 'd'. White 'a' is most popular. The other moves indicate a special strategy.

White cannot play elsewhere, as Black 'a' gives White a very unfavorable result.]
